        <p>Room Persistence Library provides an abstract layer over SQLite, allowing for a<br>more fluid and robust database access. This topic is very relevant to mobile<br>computing due to the importance of communicating with databases. The use of a<br>SQL database makes it easier to store persistent information in a relational<br>format, but there is usually a large amount of overhead required in setting up a<br>database. This is especially an issue for smaller applications, where the<br>groundwork may not even be worth the benefits. The room persistence library does<br>much of the work for you, allowing developers to much quickly prototype and<br>develop SQL-based applications. Especially in a class like this, where we are<br>trying to cover a lot of material in a short time, it would be extremely<br>beneficial to spend less time developing SQL boilerplate and more time working<br>on the important or interesting parts of the application. In addition, in order<br>to train any sort of deep learning model, we will need a large set of training,<br>testing, validation data. Thus it is important that we have an easy way to<br>access our data such that we can continually update our model.</p>
<p>In this codelab you will be finishing a small Grocery List application utilizing<br>a Room Database. You will be looking at how to set up an entity class, create a<br>Data Access Object(DAO), and how to initialize and add to your database. Please<br>utilize the starter code provided with submission.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Grocery Entity Class Set-up" duration="0">
        <p>In Room library, you need to create an Entity. In Entity class you need to<br>define the set of related fields in your Table or more specifically define the<br>schema of your relational database. The Entity class allows more much<br>customization and declaration of your Database through annotations. Some are<br>listed for reference below.</p>
<p><strong>Annotations (Class):</strong><em>\@Entity( annotations, ..., ...)</em></p>
<table>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>primaryKeys = {&#34;field1&#34;,&#34;field2&#34;}</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Define the Primary Keys in a Table</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>tableName = {&#34;name&#34;}</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Uses this name for the Table instead of the Entity Class Name</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Annotations (Fields):</strong></p>
<table>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@PrimaryKey</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Sets the field to be the Primary Key of the DB</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@ColumnInfo</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Defines the name of the field in the DB</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@NonNull</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Sets the field to not be Null in the DB</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@Ignore</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Notifies Room that this field should not be persisted</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>..</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data" target="_blank">More Info..</a></p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>You will need to navigate to the GroceryEntity class and add some information.<br>As you can see it currently only has fields for the id and name. You will need<br>to go ahead and add the entity information for quantity, notes, and filepath<br>fields as well as create the getters and setters. Please ensure you are<br>following the naming conventions used here as they are referenced in other<br>functions.</p>
<p>Creating a DAO</p>
<p>A <strong>DAO</strong> is an interface that defines the methods or search queries able to be<br>done on your DataBase. It binds a Query to each of your queries in which you<br>define. The DAO class provides a seamless and easily way of inserting, deleting<br>and updating your table. Explanations of some of the annotations are provided<br>below.</p>
<table>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@Insert</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Room Generates an implementation that inserts all DAO&#39;s into the table</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@Update</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Uses a query to update all of the DAO&#39;s respectfully in the table based on their Primary Key</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@Delete</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Removes all entities from a table based on the DAO&#39;s Primary Key</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>\@Query</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Allows you to read/write to the Database based on your customized query.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>...</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data" target="_blank">More Info..</a></p>
</td></tr>
</table>

      <google-codelab-step label="Setting up the Database Class" duration="0">
        <p>In order to create and get the database we will be utilizing a singleton pattern<br>as highlighted here below. You will need to add this block of code to the<br>getDatabase function in the GroceryDatabase Class file. Note that we will be<br>using the singleton pattern here so we ensure that we never accidentally create<br>multiple instances of our database. Also note the annotation in the class<br>declaration. Room uses annotations to add metadata to a Java source file, they<br>can&#39;t affect the semantics of a program directly. This allows Room to be able to<br>check SQL queries at compile-time, which can save a lot of development time.</p>
<p><img src="img/a445a6e865032b29.png"></p>
<p>The outer If statement exists to check whether our Database has already been<br>initialized. As the GroceryDatabase is a Singleton, where one instance shall<br>only exists, it insures static access to the one instance of our<br>GroceryDatabase. The inner if statements provides a synchronized way of creating<br>our Database if it does not exist already. As multiple calls to this method<br>could potentially cause a synchronization problem.</p>

        <p>Now you should have a functioning app with the ability to add a grocery item to<br>the database without issue. However, right now once a grocery item is added<br>there is no way to get rid of it. With the time remaining in this topic survey<br>we encourage you to play around with the other associated methods with Room and<br>perhaps add delete or update functionality. Thanks for participating!</p>
